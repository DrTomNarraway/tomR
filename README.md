# Tom R
A personal R package full of cool functions to save time on copying or rewriting common code.

## Leading-0 Versioning
I have chosen to use leading-0 versioning for this package because I am lazy and its easier for me to manage.
Therefore: ignore the leading 0; assume any 0.X change is dangerous; and, assume any 0.X.Y change is safe.
